    <h2>The Colosseum</h2>
    <p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the center of the city of Rome, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built and the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today. It's contruction began in 72 AD and was completed in 80 AD.</p>
    <h3>What was the Colosseum used for?</h3>
    <p>The structure is interesting by itself but the numerous activities done within make even more interesting. In the Colosseum, gladiatorial shows, <i>venatios</i> (animal hunts), <i>naumachiae</i> or <i>navalia proelia</i> (simulated sea battles) and <i>sylvae</i> (natural recreations) were hosted.</p>
